# ALKHALEEL: A CORPUS-BASED LEARNING TOOL FOR ARABIC

# Abstract
Language learning has been greatly facilitated by the availability of electronic resources. In particular,
electronic dictionaries, corpora, concordances, and word frequency lists have been very helpful for
language teachers and learners at the same time. In this paper we introduce an innovative tool that
combines several Arabic language resources and analysis tools in one environment and discuss how
these tools are used in the context of Arabic language learning. The tool accepts texts in different
formats including HTML, XML, plain text, and MS Word documents. It can be used to perform simple
text analysis such as calculating word frequencies and concordances, or to perform more
sophisticated analysis using Natural Language Processing techniques for morphological analysis. The
tool also includes an Arabic electronic dictionary to allow learners search for word meanings by
selecting any word in the text.
